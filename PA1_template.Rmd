## Loading and preprocessing the data
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)


Activities <- read.csv("activity.csv")
Activities$date <- ymd(Activities$date)
Activities_Per_Day <- group_by(Activities, date)
Activities_Per_Interval <- group_by(Activities, interval)



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
items <- tapply(activities$steps, activities$date, FUN=sum)
barplot(items, las=2, cex.names = 0.5)



Mean_and_Median <- summarise(activities_per_day, mean=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), n=median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
plot(Mean_and_Median$Mean, type="l", col="red", ylab = "Steps", xlab = "Day", las=2, main="Average number of steps taken")
lines(Mean_and_Median$Median, type="l", col="blue")
legend("topright", legend=c("mean", "median"), pch=1, col=c("red", "blue"))



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
